# Fuel Request App

## Backend

For the back-end we used a framework called Nest to interact with our database. To start the back-end, run the following commands.

```
cd backend
yarn install
yarn start:dev
```

## Frontend

For the front-end we used a framework called Remix to create seamless and interactive UI. To start the front-end, you must have started the backend as we are using the endpoints to interact with the database through CRUD operations.

```
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev
```
